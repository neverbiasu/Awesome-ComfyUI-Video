      "description": "[Original] In the field of portrait video generation, the use of single images to generate portrait videos has become increasingly prevalent. A common approach involves leveraging generative models to enhance adapters for controlled generation. However, control signals can vary in strength, including text, audio, image reference, pose, depth map, etc. Among these, weaker conditions often struggle to be effective due to interference from stronger conditions, posing a challenge in balancing these conditions. In our work on portrait video generation, we identified audio signals as particularly weak, often overshadowed by stronger signals such as pose and original image. However, direct training with weak signals often leads to difficulties in convergence. To address this, we propose V-Express, a simple method that balances different control signals through a series of progressive drop operations. Our method gradually enables effective control by weak conditions, thereby achieving generation capabilities that simultaneously take into account pose, input image, and audio.\nNOTE: You need to downdload [a/model_ckpts](https://huggingface.co/tk93/V-Express/tree/main) manually.",

By processing a video through the Side-by-Side (SBS) node and applying Frame Delay to one of the inputs, it facilitates the creation of a stereopsis effect. This effect is compatible with any Virtual Reality headset that supports SBS video playback, offering a practical application in immersive media experiences.",

The rationale behind the possibility of changing the size of the image in steps between the ranges of 576 and 1024, is the use of the greatest common denominator of these two numbers which is 64. SVD is lenient with resizing that adheres to this rule, so the chance of coherent video that is not the standard size of 576X1024 is greater. It is advisable to keep the value 1024 constant and play with the second size to maintain the stability of the result.",
